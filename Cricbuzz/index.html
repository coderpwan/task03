                <p>That's all for SA20 for the night. We will be back with more action soon. Till next time
                    sleep
                    well and take care. See you soon. Bye.</p>
                <p>Daniel Worrall | Player of the Match: The first one did not come out beautifully but when you
                    get
                    a lucky start like that, it is easy to come back. That's what I said to Marco, when I got
                    one
                    down the leg-side, they all count. Just being a swing bowler and trying to extract as much
                    as I
                    can from the pitch, that's the role I have in the team. Being an old guy, I need to adapt to
                    different situations. Hoping to carry that to the finals. It's a fine line, the conditions
                    dictate how full you can be and how greedy you can be. But when the captain and the coaches
                    give
                    you the confidence, it helps.</p>

                <p><strong>Aiden Markram | SEC captain:</strong> That was a nice performance. Few balls to get
                    in the right area,
                    quite fortunate with the other dismissals. Still very happy with the win and happy we took
                    all
                    our chances on the field. Happy that Malan got some runs, will do his confidence a world of
                    good. Not too sure to be honest, two close games we had we got over the line. You take that
                    away
                    and you are scrambling like last year. They go a long way and are a great help going into
                    the
                    next phase. You never take form and things for granted. You have to appreciate it and if you
                    have niggles you have to manage that. Two big games coming up against Paarl as well.</p>

                <p><strong>Faf du Plessis | JSK captain:</strong> A little bit shocked to be honest with you.
                    Not batting well and
                    not assessing the conditions. It was not pitch you get 170, also one of those days when
                    everything went wrong. Three burgles down the leg-side. Momentum is against you and we have
                    to
                    fight to change that. It feels like one of those days. You sit there and think, surely not,
                    not
                    another one down leg. That's how cricket has worked like that for a long time, when you are
                    batting well, you get dropped chances. Disappointing after Cape Town and especially with the
                    tournament going the way, we have made the last game tough for ourselves. It is like a
                    blooper,
                    you have to try and bury it quickly. You got to look ahead, one game left against a Durban
                    side
                    who are playing very well. But if we play well we are a dangerous side. You don't want to go
                    into the powerplay three down, it breaks the back and that's the learning for the next game.
                </p>

                <p><strong>20:02 Local Time, 18:02 GMT, 23:32 IST:</strong> All smiles in the <strong>SEC camp
                        as they win with a bonus point</strong>
                    and move 2nd on the table. The bowlers set it up as all the four seamers shared 10 wickets
                    between them to bowl JSK out for 78. 79 was a cakewalk and Malan importantly got his eye in
                    and
                    showed signs of getting his touch back. Just the lone wicket of Hermann and the job was done
                    easily and clinically. JSK lost the game in the first innings and despite the hammering
                    tonight,
                    they stay fourth. But they have just one more game left and the race for fourth is getting
                    interesting by the minute. SEC become the third team to qualify tonight. Stay tuned for the
                    presentation...</p>
